Written for Python3. The flask application is hosted in another github repository at
https://github.com/avkoehl/congressional-debates-webapp and the website can be accessed
at http://ds.lib.ucdavis.edu/debates/

Ongoing Project to provide an API to several nlp methods, mainly related to linguistic shifts, on 
a corpus of different texts related to the American Civil War. Currently, the corpora are
the congressional-globe (congressional debates) and the War of Rebellion Corpus from the 
University of Ohio.

Projects that I have significantly borrowed from for this work are from Stony Brook University
http://viveksck.github.io/langchangetrack/ and the Stanford Histwords project
